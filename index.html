      <h2>Welcome to the land of Sends and data analysis</h2>
      <p>
        Here you can use all you previous performances in order to tailor you training planning, inform decisions
        about your next trip or just show off to your friends. <br>
        The main tab you'll be interested in is the Dashboard.</p>

      <h2>The Dashboard:</h2>

      <p>
        The Dashboard shows a serie of graph ranging from the classical grades pyramid to the max, min and average
        number of tries per grade. <br>
        On this tab you can edit the filters of the second row (Climber, Grade, Crag, etc.)
      </p>

      <h2>Try these:</h2>

      <p>
        "What's my hardest send on slab?" <br>
        âžœ Filter the climber on your name, choose the slab Profil and Route (from Route / Boulder). <br>
        Paow! Looking at the Pyramid you'll see 7b. It's magic!
      </p>

      <p>
        "What's my average number of tries on 7c?" <br>
        âžœ Filter the climber on your name, choose route (or boulder). <br>
        WAM! Looking at the graph # Tries per grade
        you'll see 3 tries. Nice job!
      </p>

      <p>
        "I want to training effciently. What type of boulders do I climb most?" <br>
        âžœ Filter the climber on your name, choose boulder. <br>
        Et voilÃ . Take a look at the pie graphs showing your dominant hold types and the profil one. Now let's go
        train
        these!
      </p>

      <p>
        "I feel like I'm stagnating. Is that true?" <br>
        âžœ Filter the climber on your name. Take a look at the volume of ascents (Route/Boulder per Season) from one
        season to the next. <br>
        Then take a look at the evolution of your Top Ten.
